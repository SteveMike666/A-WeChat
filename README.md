##Recent Plan
The project structure will be sorted out in the near future, and the entire project will be modularized at the code level, mainly including:
* Chat interface rebuilding, logically independent;
* Primary control class logic collation;
* Major lists are refactored with ZZFLEX to increase their extensibility;
* ZZFLEX encapsulates a UIKit layer, mainly including a data-driven list framework, and chain extensions of commonly used controls in UIKit. ZZFLEX-related data is being collated and is currently being sourced.
* iOS11 adapter;
